### Problem

- Documents get passed around via email all the time.
- These documents can be long and it can be tedious or impossible to visually compare two 100 page.

### Usage

- Upload the document you want to track
- We'll track that document over time using a unique hash generated from the bytes/data of that document when it was uploaded.
- If you upload the same doc multiple times, we'll create a snapshot for each upload and store that hash on BitcoinSV.
- Compare existing documents against previously uploaded ones
- Generate a unique link proving an attached document hasn't been modified. Include that link in email correspondence with your colleagues as proof.

### ContractSV

- Use the bitcoin sv blockchain to validate the proof of a document being uploaded and validated.
